# Stackoverflow Anticopy

![Stackoverflow Anticopy](icon.png)

A browser extension to prevent you for copying code from stackoverflow.

> Adopted from [Alex Garrett-Smith](https://twitter.com/alexjgarrett) extension. Extended to support, `CTRL+c/v`, `CTRL + insert` and `SHIFT + enter` as well. I've never got a chance to work on v3 chrome extensions so to learn it, I could not think of any other good idea. All thanks to [Alex Garrett-Smith](https://twitter.com/alexjgarrett).

### Current Status 

> Chrome extension has been submitted to chrome webstore and it is under `pending review` stage. Do watch the repo, in case you dont want to miss out on it. I'll update the link here once it's published.
